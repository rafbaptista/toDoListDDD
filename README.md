# To Do List Application

This is a very simple application, where you can register a person, with name, age, gender and optionally upload a picture, and then you can create a task and assign to that person.

Each task has a description, category, status, delivery date and a person responsable for it, which can be chosen by the user at any time.

Although very simple, this project was built using a lot of technologies, some of them just for knowledge and didactic purposes:

• .NET Framework 4.6.1  
• ASP.NET MVC 5  
• SQL Server  
• Entity Framework Code First
• Fluent API (Mapping)  
• Bootstrap 4.4.
• AutoMapper  
• Chart.js 2.9  
• Simple Injector 
• ViewModels/Models  
• Custom Attributes  
• Extension Methods  

## Architecture

For didactic purposes, this project was built based on DDD (Domain Driven Design), whose objective is to facilite the implementation of complex rules and processes, diving responsabilities by layers and being independent of the technology used.
